 Welcome to ***Zelda Archaeology*** *(ZA)*, a central location for everything related to *Zelda* theories. 
  
 *ZA* is an open source community project, with everything shared under the open source **Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 4.0)**. 
  
 Our goal is to gather the internet's collective *Zelda* theories and compile them into an ever expanding and shifting - but easy to reference - format. 
 We aim to ① **collect and organize** well thought out *Zelda* theories, ② **publish them digitally** for free on a version controlled website, and ③ finally **publish them physically** in a set of beautiful coffee table books akin to the [*Master Works*](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild_–_Creating_a_Champion) reference book - potentially funded/sold through Kickstarter (or equivalent) with proceeds going to those that helped through contributions in making and selling the books. 
  
 We're a group of archaeologists, collectively traversing and debating the deeper meanings found within the rich worlds of *The Legend of Zelda* series. 
 We just want to share our love of the best video game series ever, in a way that we can be proud of for decades to come. 
  
 ## Project Motivation 
  
 New *Legend of Zelda* games are released only every few years. 
 In between those milestone events, it's the fans that keep the *Zelda* excitement alive by sharing every scrap of news or rumors about upcoming releases, creating art and discussing the finer details of each game. 
  
 Some of the best *Zelda* content on the web are the increasingly in-depth fan theories. 
 These theories highlight details that are seldom explicit within the games themselves, weaving together a rich tapestry of depth that transcend the games themselves. 
 A sort of meta-analysis of the series as a whole, rather than focusing on the canonical events of each game individually. 
 Often pushing up against official canon by inferring details not explicitly stated - or even intended - by *Nintendo*, this dedicated community of *Zelda* fans find patterns casual players typically don't see. 
  
 Sometimes, these theories take on canonical meaning when *Nintendo* adopts them officially - for example, the official *Zelda* timeline was originally an elaborate fan theory. 
 While at other times, fan favorite theories are cast by the wayside as new games are released and core pillars of those theories are dismantled by the newly integrated official canon. 
  
 But that's just part of the fun in developing and debating *Zelda* theories! 
  
 Across the 35 years of *Zelda* games, the ever shifting landscape of theories are currently found scattered all over the internet in nearly every format imaginable. 
 They're discussed in forums dating back to pre social media times. 
 They're found in Discord and Slack channels. 
 They're fleshed out on Facebook, Twitter, and whatever else the cool kids are doing these days. 
 You'll find them on Reddit, blogs, fan wikis and YouTube. 
  
 There's a huge world of theories out there, so many that it's hard to keep track of them all. 
 And while many other congregating websites focus on "*Zelda* facts," - the canonical events from the games and explicit statements made by *Nintendo* through official channels - I feel like the well thought out *Zelda* theories are where the most interesting content resides. 
  
 ***Zelda Archaeology*** is the central location for these theories. 
  
 ## Project Vision 
  
 While the process outlined below will most likely be more organic than the documentation makes it feel, here are the high level phases we'll be following. 
  
 ### Phase 1  - Collecting and Organizing (Current Phase) 
  
 The first step is to get a good idea of the landscape. We'll need all the help we can get (see how to [contribute](#contribute) below) as we scour the internet, compiling huge lists of URLs that discuss specific *Zelda* theories. 
 Then we'll collectively organize that list into categories that make sense, getting them ready for **Phase 2**. 
  
 ### Phase 2 - Writing and Online Publishing 
  
 We'll rewrite all of those theories (yes, all of them) in a consistent format and voice, ready for publishing online. 
 Then we'll build a public friendly version controlled website to publish everything, keeping every original reference intact like the caring and responsible researchers we are. 
 In a community effort like this, the original creators of the ideas in a Discord channel are just as important as the final YouTubers that make it known to their thousands of subscribers. 
  
 ### Phase 3 - Physical Publishing 
  
 There's no telling how large this project will end up being, but it's easy to imagine it could span multiple books. 
 We'll look for artists and print designers within the community to help create physical books for your bookshelf - all organized in a way that you're proud to display. 
  
 These books will be sold by anyone through an affiliate program, with the profits being distributed fairly to everyone who has contributed to the creation of the content. 
  
 ## Contribute 
  
 *ZA* is an open source project - built entirely by you - a special breed of passionate *Zelda* fan that wants to share the beauty of the legendary worlds you love. 
 There is no central authority or gatekeeper here, only maintainers of quality standards. 
  
 So if you've ever lurked on forums, put up a blog post, posted a comment, talked to a friend or made a YouTube video about a *Zelda* theory, *we need you!*

This README is quite thorough and well-explained already, but here are a few suggestions that could make it even more effective.

    Highlight Key Information: You have done a good job of explaining the project, but some key information may get lost in the verbosity. Highlighting key points can help the reader understand the project and its goals quicker.

    Include a Table of Contents: Because the README is quite long, a table of contents at the beginning would be helpful. This way, the reader can skip to the sections they are most interested in.

    Use Sub-headers for Improved Readability: In the "Project Motivation" and "Project Vision" sections, consider adding sub-headers to break down the text. This makes the document easier to read and can guide readers to the most relevant sections.

    Define Technical Terms: Not all readers may be familiar with terms like "version controlled" and "open source". Consider adding short definitions or links to further information.

    Include Examples or Visuals: Showcasing a few example theories or diagrams could help the reader understand the kind of content you're looking for. Additionally, images or diagrams can break up long text sections and make the README more engaging.

    Specify Contribution Guidelines: It's mentioned that the project needs contributors, but it would be helpful to explicitly list what kinds of contributions are needed. Are you looking for writers, editors, web developers, artists, etc.?

    Condense Text Where Possible: Some sections, like the project motivation, could be more concise. The key to an effective README is balancing comprehensive information with readability.

Here's a revised excerpt as an example:
Project Motivation

Legend of Zelda games are released every few years. In between, fans keep the excitement alive by sharing news, creating art, and discussing game details. One of the most engaging fan-created content forms are the in-depth fan theories. They highlight game details that aren't always explicit and weave a rich tapestry that transcends individual games.

However, these theories are scattered across various platforms, making it hard to keep track of them. Zelda Archaeology aims to be the central location for these theories, offering a comprehensive, easy-to-reference collection of the most intriguing ideas proposed by the Zelda fan community.

### Phase 1 - Collecting and Organizing (Current Phase)
We're currently compiling a comprehensive list of *Zelda* theories from across the web, categorizing them in preparation for Phase 2.

### Phase 2 - Writing and Online Publishing
In this phase, we'll rewrite theories in a consistent format and publish them on our website, always attributing the original creators.
