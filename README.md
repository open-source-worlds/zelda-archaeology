## About ZA

Our mission is to collect, organize, and publish the web's best *Zelda* theories in a convenient, digital format. We also plan to publish physical coffee-table books, akin to the [*Master Works*](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild_â€“_Creating_a_Champion) reference book. Our efforts are under the Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 4.0).

As *Zelda* enthusiasts, we strive to dig deep into the legendary worlds of *The Legend of Zelda* series, fostering love and appreciation for the world's best video game series.

## Project Motivation

New *Legend of Zelda* games only appear every few years. Fans keep the franchise alive, sharing news, art, and discussions. In-depth fan theories have become a significant part of this engagement, offering intriguing insights and novel interpretations of the game series.

However, these theories are scattered across various online platforms, making them difficult to find and follow. ZA aims to change this, becoming a comprehensive and easily accessible hub for these theories.

## Project Vision

While our process will likely evolve organically, we envision our project developing in the following phases:

### Phase 1 - Collecting and Organizing (Current Phase)
We're currently compiling a comprehensive list of *Zelda* theories from across the web, categorizing them in preparation for Phase 2.

### Phase 2 - Writing and Online Publishing
In this phase, we'll rewrite theories in a consistent format and publish them on our website, always attributing the original creators.

### Phase 3 - Physical Publishing
We aspire to compile theories into beautifully designed physical books, with sales profits fairly distributed among contributors.
